Quick Start Guide
*************************************************

The first section helps users navigate to a tutorial for automating commutation
using the specific set of hardware and software that they have. The second
section helps users test core functionality of their commutator without any
tracking.

Verify Commutator's Core Functionality 
======================================

This quick start guide provides basic setup instructions to verify the
commutator's functionality -- that it can accept turn commands through serial
communication over its USB connection --  without no additional hardware
requirements or automated tracking features. By following these steps, you will
be able to turn the commutator using keyboard presses from a `Bonsai
<https://bonsai-rx.org>`__ workflow.

#.  If you have not already done so,

    *   `Download and Install Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/installation.html>`_
    *   Open Bonsai and `install the Bonsai.StarterPack package <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/packages.html>`_ 

#.  Connect the commutator to computer using a USB-C (Micro-USB in older 
    versions) cable to establish power and communication between the commutator
    and the computer. 

    ..  note:: 
        The commutator's RGB LED will flash red when the commutator is plugged in. 
        During this time, the commutator is charging an internal supercapacitor 
        bank that prevents the motor from loading the USB port. This can take up to 
        30 seconds to complete.

#.  Position the commutator such that the commutator's gears can rotate freely.

#.  Download and run the following .bonsai file (also known as a "workflow") for
    controlling the commutator using key presses:

    ..  raw:: html

        {% with static_path = './_static/', name = 'commutator-keypress-control' %}
            {% include 'workflow.html' %}
        {% endwith %}

#.  Configure the **PortName** property of the **SerialWriteLine** node to
    reflect the port to which the commutator is connected:

    *   In Bonsai, click the **SerialWriteLine** node and modify the
        **PortName** property (highlighted below).

        ..  image:: /_static/images/bonsai-keypress-comport.png

    *   The **PortName** property enumerates detected COM ports when the field
        is clicked. If multiple COM ports are available when the commutator is
        connected, try disconnecting and reconnecting your commutator. The COM
        port that disappears/reappears from the enumerated list when
        disconnecting/reconnecting your commutator is the one that corresponds
        to your commutator. Set **PortName** to this COM port.

#.  Run the workflow in Bonsai by pressing the green Start arrow.

    *   Et voil√†! The commutator motor now rotates when the left and right arrow
        keys are pressed on the keyboard.
    *   The angular displacement per key-press can be adjusted by clicking the
        **String** nodes and modifying the **Value** property
    *   To see the JSON commands being sent to the commutator, double-click the
        **SerialWriteLine** node while the workflow is running to show a text
        visualizer.

After confirming its functionality, you are ready to start setting up your
commutator for an experiment. Start with learning more in-depth about
:doc:`/user-guide/mount-connect` your commutator.

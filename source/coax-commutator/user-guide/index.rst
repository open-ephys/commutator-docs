User Guide
*************************************************

.. attention:: If you haven't verified the core functionality of your Open
   Ephys commutator, refer to the :ref:`quick_start` guide.

The coaxial commutator can be used with ultra lightweight, high-bandwidth
coaxial cables to provide near zero-torque commutation of `miniscopes
<https://open-ephys.org/miniscope-v4/miniscope-v4>`__  or `coaxial heastages
<https://open-ephys.github.io/onix-docs/Hardware%20Guide/Headstages/index.html>`__.
This user guide details how to use the coaxial commutator for this purpose.

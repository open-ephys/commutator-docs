Ultra-Coax

((overview-start))
Welcome to the Ultra-Coax Commutator documentation. The Ultra-Coax tether is a lightweight high-bandwidth
(18 GHz) coaxial cable that promotes natural animal behavior during animal behavior experiments. The Ultra-Coax
Commutator commutates it to preserve the integrity of the tether and prevent disconnections or any torsion/torque on the
mouse.

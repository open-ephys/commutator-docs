* To start operating the commutator as quickly as possible (using key presses), refer to the quick-start guide.

* To learn other ways to control commutation, including interfacing the commutator with orientation data from specific hardware (such as miniscope v4, Onix, and custom hardware), refer to the more in-depth user guide.

* To learn how to design or build your own commutator, refer to the developer guide.

.. TODO::
    * Better description
    * Make this page modular too (the problem is that doing 1 overview.rst doc will force the same title to occur in the header)
    * Put picture of ultra-coax commutator
    * Put references

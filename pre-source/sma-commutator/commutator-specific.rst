Welcome to the Ultra-Coax Commutator documentation. The Ultra-Coax tether is a lightweight high-bandwidth (18 GHz)
coaxial cable that promotes natural animal behavior during animal behavior experiments. The Ultra-Coax Commutator
commutates it to preserve the integrity of the tether and prevent disconnections or any torsion/torque on the behaving
animal.

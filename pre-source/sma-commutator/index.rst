* To start operating the commutator as quickly as possible (using key presses), refer to the :doc:`quick-start guide<quick-start-guide>`.

* To learn other ways to control commutation, including interfacing the commutator with orientation data from specific hardware (such as miniscope v4, Onix, and custom hardware), refer to the more in-depth :doc:`user guide<user-guide>`.

* To learn how to design or build your own commutator, refer to the :doc:`developer guide<developer-guide>`.

.. TODO::
    * reformat picture next to words like overview page
    * Make this page modular too (the problem is that doing one overview.rst doc will force the same title to occur in the header)

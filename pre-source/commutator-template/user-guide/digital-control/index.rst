How to Control Commutator
**************************************************************

The user can control the commutator manually or through a computer's serial interface.

* **Manual Control:** The commutator's manual control system allows the user to change the commutator's direction, enable/disable the commutator, and toggle LED functionality with buttons on the commutator enclosure.
* **Computer Control:** The commutator's computer control system allows the user to perform the same functions as above as well as change the speed of commutation and query the commutator's settings user a serial communication interface. This also allows the user to interface the commutator with other software and hardware to automate the commutation process. This can be used to relieve torsion exerted on a behaving animal by a twisted electrical or optical tether

The following sections detail the two commutator control modalities

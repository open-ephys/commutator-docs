Bill of Materials (BoM)

Off-the-shelf parts:

This BoM contains links to Digikey and to get a sense of the price, but there are lots of other places to get these parts.
This BoM was created using prices on March 1st, 2023.

Custom parts:
Prices depend on where you decide to manufacture these parts. You can get a 5-pack of PCBs from JLCPCB for cheap. The
commutator enclosure can be made by any service that 3D prints with SLS or MJF technologies.

Open Source Designs
*************************************************

The designs for the OECs are open-source. Accordingly, all of the files relevant to manufacturing the commutator is
available in this `publicly available Open Ephys Github repo <https://github.com/open-ephys/onix-commutator>`_. The
downloads are also available below:

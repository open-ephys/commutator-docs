Quick Start
*************************************************

.. important:: Although this example uses `Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org>`__
   and Windows, the commutator communicates over a serial connection using a
   simple :ref:`set of JSON commands <remote_control>` and therefore is
   software and operating system agnostic.

This quick start guide provides a basic setup instructions to verify the
commutator's functionality.  By following these steps, you will be able to turn
the commutator using keyboard presses from a  `Bonsai Visual Programming
Language <https://bonsai-rx.org>`__ workflow.

#. If you have not already done so,

   * `Download and Install Bonsai
     <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/installation.html>`_
   * Open Bonsai and `install the Bonsai.StarterPack package
     <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/packages.html>`_

#. Connect a computer to the commutator using a micro-USB
   cable (connector 1 in the figure below) to establish power and communication
   between the commutator and the computer. For this quick start guide, the
   coaxial connections are not needed.

   .. note:: The commutator's RGB LED will flash red when the commutator is
      plugged in. During this time, the commutator is charging an internal
      supercapacitor bank that prevents the motor from loading the USB port. This
      can take up to 30 seconds to complete.

#. Position the commutator on a table and ensure there is nothing preventing
   the commutator's gears from rotating freely.

#. Download and run the following .bonsai file (also known as a "workflow") for
   controlling the commutator using key presses:

   .. raw:: html

            {% with static_path = '../../_static', name = 'commutator-keypress-control' %}
                {% include 'workflow.html' %}
            {% endwith %}
            <br>

#. Configure the **PortName** property of the **SerialWriteString** node to
   reflect the port to which the commutator is connected. To
   determine to which port the commutator is connected to:

   * Open the `Device Manager
     <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-device-manager-a7f2db46-faaf-24f0-8b7b-9e4a6032fc8c>`_
     and expand the **Ports** directory. The correct port is indicated by the
     **Teensy USB Serial** entry as seen as in the below example screenshot.  In
     this example, the correct port is **COM5**

     .. image:: /_static/images/teensy-device-manager.jpg

   * In Bonsai, click the **SerialWriteString** node and modify the
     **PortName** property (highlighted below) to the value found in the
     previous step

     .. image:: /_static/images/bonsai-keypress-comport.png

#. Run the workflow in Bonsai by pressing the green Start arrow.

   * Et voil√†! The commutator motor now rotates when the left and right arrow
     keys are pressed on the keyboard.
   * The angular displacement per key-press can be adjusted by clicking the
     **String** nodes and modifying the **Value** property
   * To see the JSON commands being sent to the commutator, double-click the
     **SerialStringWrite** node while the workflow is running to show a text
     visualizer.

#. After confirming the functionality of the commutator, you are ready to mount
   it above your behavioral arena and start using it for automated commutation
   during experiments with
   `UCLA miniscopes <https://open-ephys.org/miniscope-v4/miniscope-v4>`_ and
   `ONIX headstages
   <https://open-ephys.github.io/onix-docs/Hardware%20Guide/Headstages/index.html>`_.

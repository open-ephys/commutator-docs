This section outlines how to use Bonsai software to automate commutation of the coaxial
tether between a headstage-64 mounted on a freely moving animal and ONIX.

#. Follow the :ref:`quick_start` to ensure you can control the commutator using Bonsai.

#. Install the **Bonsai.ONIX** Package from Bonsai's package manager.

   - Select Community Feed

   - Install **Bonsai.ONIX**

   .. Note:: You will not be able to open the workflow if ONIX is not already properly installed and connected

#. Download, configure, and run the following Bonsai workflow for automating commutation using orientation
   data from the headstageâ€™s on-board IMU sensor:

   .. raw:: html

            {% with static_path = '../../../_static', name = 'onix-coaxheadstage-commutate' %}
                {% include 'workflow.html' %}
            {% endwith %}

   -  Configure the **CommutatorSerialPort** property of the **BNO055 9-Axis IMU & Commutator** node to reflect the port
      to which the commutator is connected.

   -  Configure the **EnableStream** property of the **BNO055 9-Axis IMU & Commutator** node as *True*.

   -  Configure the **DeviceAddress** property of the **BNO055 9-Axis IMU & Commutator** node to reflect the address in
      which corresponds to the BNO055 for this particular headstage device. The correct address can be found by
      referencing the ONIContext table.

#. Run the workflow in Bonsai. If all above steps are correctly performed, the commutator will follow headstage rotations

Digital Commutator Control
**************************************************************

The commutator's digital control system allows the user to:

* Enable/disable the commutator
* Command the commutator to turn
* Change the speed of commutator's speed of rotation
* Toggle the LED Feedback function
* Query the commutator's settings

This digital control system equipped with the above set of commands allows the user to interface the commutator with
other software and hardware to automate the commutation process for the purpose of (for example) preserving the signal
integrity and relieving the torsion exerted on a freely moving animal during animal behavior experiments.

The following sections detail how the user can accomplish this.
